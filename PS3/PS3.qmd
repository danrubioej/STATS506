## PS3

Daniel Rubio, 10/10/24

As an aid to my problem solving, I used UM GPT to probe for explanations when I was confused, and for suggestions of possible built in functions to use. I did not copy and paste the prompts into the AI, but rather used it to answer the questions I had as they arose.

# Problem 1: Vision

## (a)

I downloaded the two files and placed them in my directory PS3 alongside this quarto document.

```{r}
#setwd("/Users/danrubio/Desktop/STATS 506/PS3") #ran this once

```
